# Verification log

Each slice appends a section: what ran, the exact commands, pass/fail per
check, and anything that could not be verified with the reason. All runs are
on the build host described in `ARCHITECTURE.md` section 0 (rootless Nix
2.20, KVM available; every VM test ran under KVM, none under TCG).

## Slice (a): flake skeleton, option tree, mkSite, site template, minimal host

Commands:

```
nix flake check -L --keep-going      # 2026-09-10, "running 9 flake checks", exit 0
```

| check | result | evidence |
|---|---|---|
| fmt | pass | nixfmt --check over every .nix file |
| statix | pass | `statix.toml` disables only `repeated_keys` (dotted keys are the module idiom) |
| deadnix | pass | |
| no-hardware-facts | pass | grep over the tree excluding `tests/`, `hardware.nix`, the brief and the design-token inventory |
| option-docs | pass | every `nixie.*` option has a description (evaluated, not built) |
| eval-matrix | pass | five throwaway sites evaluate: no GPU with a data disk, one NIC with NVIDIA, no TPM with encryption, no data disk desktop with TPM, VM |
| profile-server-has-no-desktop | pass | closure of the example server contains no hyprland, cage, chromium, firefox, quickshell, greetd |
| profile-desktop-has-no-server | pass | closure of the example laptop contains no incus, opentofu, prometheus, grafana, restic, cockpit |
| vm-boot-plain | pass | example server boots under OVMF + swtpm; admin user exists from the sops secret, sshd active; "test script finished in 17.19s" |

Not verified in this slice: the disko layout is declared and evaluated but
not applied (the test framework supplies its own disk); a real install is the
subject of slice (b). The `nix why-depends` form of the profile check is
replaced by a pure closure grep (`closureInfo`); the equivalent manual
command is `nix why-depends .#checks.x86_64-linux.vm-boot-plain.driver nixpkgs#cage`.
